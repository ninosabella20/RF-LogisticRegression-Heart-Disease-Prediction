# Heart Disease Detection using Machine Learning (R)

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the risk of heart disease using a dataset from Kaggle. We utilize machine learning algorithms, specifically Logistic Regression and Random Forest, to analyze various patient attributes and determine their likelihood of having heart disease.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of the following features:

- **age**: Age of the patient
- **sex**: Gender of the patient (1 = male; 0 = female)
- **chest pain type**: Type of chest pain (4 values)
- **resting blood pressure**: Blood pressure in mm Hg
- **serum cholesterol**: Cholesterol level in mg/dl
- **fasting blood sugar**: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)
- **resting electrocardiographic results**: Results of electrocardiographic test (values 0, 1, 2)
- **maximum heart rate achieved**: Maximum heart rate achieved
- **exercise induced angina**: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
- **old peak**: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- **slope of peak exercise**: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (values 0, 1, 2)
- **number of major vessels**: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
- **thal**: Thalassemia (1 = normal; 2 = fixed defect; 3 = reversable defect)

## Data Handling

- **Renamed Columns**: Improved readability of column names.
- **Checked for Missing Values**: Ensured data quality and completeness.

## Model Development

### Logistic Regression

- Created a Logistic Regression model to predict heart disease risk.
- **Model Evaluation**:
  - **Accuracy**: 85%
  - **Confusion Matrix**:
    - True Negatives (0,0): 123
    - False Negatives (1,0): 18
    - False Positives (0,1): 27
    - True Positives (1,1): 140
  - **ROC AUC**: 0.94

**Analysis**: 
- The model identified 18 patients at risk who were not flagged, and 27 patients not at risk who were incorrectly identified as at risk.

### Model Tuning

- Adjusted the probability threshold for predicting at-risk patients from 0.5 to 0.25.
- Resulted in:
  - **New Accuracy**: 86%
  - **Confusion Matrix**: Improved detection of at-risk patients, reducing false negatives to 7 and increasing false positives to 36.

### Random Forest Model

- Developed a Random Forest model with 100 trees.
- **Model Evaluation**:
  - **Accuracy**: 98%
  - **Confusion Matrix**:
    - True Negatives: 150
    - True Positives: 152
    - False Positives: 0
    - False Negatives: 6
  - **ROC AUC**: 1

**Analysis**: 
- The Random Forest model achieved high accuracy with no false positives, indicating excellent performance.

## Conclusion

The Logistic Regression and Random Forest models demonstrated effective predictions for heart disease risk. The tuning of prediction thresholds improved the modelâ€™s reliability, highlighting the importance of evaluating and adjusting model parameters for optimal performance.

## Future Work

- Explore additional machine learning models and ensemble methods to enhance predictive performance.
- Investigate feature importance and selection to understand the impact of each attribute on heart disease risk.
